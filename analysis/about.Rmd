This is the site displaying all the analysis notes for a study aiming at cracking human cognitive structure. Recently, @thompson2019 tried this on a data from [ABCD Study](https://abcdstudy.org/) baseline dataset. In another research by @eisenberg2019, the so-called **data-driven ontology** method is introduced, which combines exploratory factor analysis and cluster analysis to find the psychological spaces from data. These two studies did great jobs but it remains to be explored when using this **data-driven ontology** method in datasets with more tasks included.

Here we collected data from more than 50 cognitive neuroscience tasks. We deem it is enough for our exploratory analysis although there might be some neglected behavioral paradigms. These tasks were administered to more than 5000 children, which were completed in one month.
